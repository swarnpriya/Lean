# Lean
* Lean aims to bridge the gap between interactive and automative theorem proving. 
* In Lean we create a skeleton of the proof for any theorem or any staifiability problem and then the "holes" are
  automatically discharged by tool like Z3.
* Lean has support for metaprogramming.
* From Lean we can call Z3. So it supports both interactive proving as well as automative proving. It has supoort for the
  tactic that calls Z3 when the user is in Lean itself. Translate Lean theorem and goals to Z3 theorem and goals using Lean.
* Users can create their own automation, extend and customize Lean. 
* It has white box automation.
